    `This Visitor Agreement (the “Agreement”) must be signed by all adult (eighteen years and older) 
    Visitors to climbing gyms owned, operated, or managed by LOTUS MGMT LLC, a California limited liability
    company, doing business as Lotus Climbing Gyms (the “Gym”). “Visitors” in this Agreement means
    persons who are engaged in the Activities of the Gym, observing or assisting the Activities of others,
    or are otherwise in, on or moving about the premises of the Gym. “Gym” as used in this Agreement
    includes the Gym itself, its facilities and adjacent areas including its lawn and parking lot, and other
    activity sites. If the Visitor is a minor, at least one parent or legal (court-appointed) guardian (either,
    “Parent”) must sign below, as evidence of their agreement to these terms and conditions, for
    themselves and, to the maximum extent allowed by law, on behalf of a minor Visitor for whom they
    sign. This Agreement may be signed by or on behalf of more than one Visitor. If a minor is
    accompanied to the Gym by a Parent, the Parent shall sign below on behalf of himself/herself as an
    adult Visitor and, by that signature, agree also, as required, on behalf of the minor Visitor(s)
    identified in this Agreement. If you are not the minor’s Parent, then you may not sign this Agreement
    on their behalf.
    In consideration of being allowed on the premises of the Gym I, an adult Visitor and/or Parent of a
    minor Visitor (for myself and on behalf of that minor Visitor), acknowledge and agree as follows:`,

    "t2": 
    `1. Activities. Activities of the Gym (“Activities”) include, but are not limited to, the following:
        climbing, the use of bouldering structures, bouldering areas and related equipment; the use of
        weights, cardio and other training and fitness equipment; the use of saunas, showers and locker
        room facilities and equipment; participation in special activities or events including gear
        demonstrations, parties, social events, and clinics; participation in yoga and other fitness classes,
        personal training, group training, camps and classes; the rental or borrowing of equipment from the
        Gym; consuming food, drinks (including alcoholic); moving about the Gym and outside areas
        including parking lots; and other activities and use of facilities and equipment at the Gym. A Visitor
        under the age of sixteen must be accompanied by a responsible adult, who must inform the minor of
        Gym rules and warnings, and be immediately available to assist the minor in managing the risks of
        Activities. Visitors who have consumed alcohol at the Gym, or prior to visiting the Gym, are not
        allowed to climb, use the sauna, weights, other fitness equipment, participate in yoga or fitness
        classes, or otherwise engage in physical activities at the Gym.`,

    "t3": 
    `2. Risks. I recognize and understand that there are risks, hazards and dangers in the Activities which
        could result in losses and injuries of all kinds, including damage to property, physical injury, illness,
        permanent disability, trauma or death. Visitors must not assume that they are being supervised or
        even observed by Gym staff. Visitors are responsible for their own safety and welfare and, if a
        visiting Parent or other responsible adult, for the safety and welfare of the minor Visitor who
        accompanies them. The risks involved in Activities include but are not limited to: parking and moving
        about parking and other areas of the Gym and its exterior; falling from any height, collisions with and
        being struck by objects, people or structures; falling onto uneven, worn or hard surfaces, including
        defective, worn, uneven, broken, separated or additional flooring or pads; equipment failure even if
        the equipment is properly used; failure of any part or all of the equipment or structures in the Gym,
        including bouldering structures, holds, rental equipment, flooring systems, and training and fitness
        equipment; misuse of equipment; and the conduct, including negligent conduct, of other Visitors or
        staff or independent contractors. Independent contractors may conduct certain Activities, including,
        but not limited to, yoga classes, fitness classes, and personal training. These and other risks are
        inherent in a visit to the Gym; that is, they cannot be eliminated without changing the nature of the
        visit and participation in Activities. Participation in Activities is voluntary and Visitors may withdraw
        from participation at any time.`,

    "t4": 
    `3. Assumption of Risks. Understanding that the Activities expose me (or the minor) to a high risk of
        injury or other loss, I knowingly and voluntarily assume and accept all risks of those Activities,
        inherent and otherwise, known or unknown, and whether or not described above. If the Visitor is a
        minor, I have explained the activities and risks to him or her, and the minor wishes to participate in
        the Activities nevertheless.`,

    "t5":
    `4. RELEASE OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION. I, AN ADULT VISITOR AND/OR PARENT
        OR GUARDIAN OF A VISITOR WHO IS A MINOR (FOR MYSELF AND AS PARENT OR
        GUARDIAN, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ON BEHALF OF THE MINOR)
        AGREE NOT TO SUE, AND TO RELEASE, DISCHARGE, HOLD HARMLESS AND INDEMNIFY
        (THAT IS, DEFEND AND PAY, INCLUDING COSTS, ATTORNEYS FEES AND INSURANCE
        DEDUCTIBLES) LOTUS LLC, LOTUS FITNESS HOLDINGS INC., LOTUS MGMT LLC,
        VERTICAL SOLUTIONS, LLC, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS PROVIDING SERVICES AS PART
        OF ACTIVITIES AT THE GYM, THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF THE PROPERTIES ON
        WHICH ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED, AND THE RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, OWNERS,
        OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, AND EMPLOYEES OF THESE ENTITIES (THE “RELEASED
        PARTIES”) WITH RESPECT TO ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS, LIABILITY, OR CAUSES OF ACTION
        ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO MY OR THE MINOR CHILD’S VISIT TO THE
        GYM, USE OF ITS FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AND PARTICIPATION IN THE ACTIVITIES OF
        THE GYM. THESE AGREEMENTS OF RELEASE AND INDEMNITY INCLUDE CLAIMS OF
        NEGLIGENCE (BUT NOT GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONALLY WRONGFUL CONDUCT) OF
        A RELEASED PARTY.`,

    "t6":
    `5. Other Provisions.`,

    "t7":
    `a) I agree that I or the minor have no physical limitations or medical conditions that would
        impair my or the minor’s ability to fully and safely use the Gym or participate in the Activities
        without causing harm to ourselves or others.`,

    "t8":
    `b) I understand that in order to participate in Activities I, for myself or for the minor Visitor of
        whom I am Parent, must sign this Agreement; I, and/or the minor, must complete whatever
        instructional and/or orientation program the Gym requires for the particular activity; and I, or
        the minor, must read and abide by the Gym Rules and Regulations (as set forth below and
        amended from time to time).`,

    "t9":
    `c) The Gym is not responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged personal property of Visitors while
        Visitors are at the Gym.`,

    "t10":
    `d) The Gym does not have medical personnel or treatment available to Visitors. In the event of
        an accident, I authorize Gym staff to obtain medical care, including transportation to a medical
        facility, for me or the minor Visitor if, in the opinion of the Gym, medical care is needed and I
        am unable to make such decisions for myself or the minor. I agree to pay all costs associated
        with such actions on the part of the Gym and to indemnify and hold harmless the Released
        Parties from any consequences of such care.`,

    "t11":
    `e) Gym staff is hereby authorized to take photos and video of me or the minor in connection
        with participation in Activities and has my permission to use my, or the minor’s, name and
        likeness, without compensation, for marketing and other promotional purposes.`,

    "t12": 
    `f) I understand that this Agreement shall apply to my, and/or the minor’s, visits to the Gym on
        this date and hereafter unless and until it is replaced or modified by a new agreement
        between the parties to this Agreement. Such new agreement shall apply only to visits
        thereafter and shall not affect rights and obligations arising from prior visits, under this
        Agreement.`,
    
    "t13":
    `g) This Agreement constitutes the complete and sole agreement between me (the minor
        Visitor, if applicable) and the Released Parties. Evidence of any other agreements, whether
        oral or in writing, are void and inadmissible and unenforceable in a court of law, arbitration or
        other dispute resolution proceeding. If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid, the
        remaining portions shall survive and continue in full force and effect.`,
    
    "t14":
    `h) Any dispute between an adult or minor Visitor and a Released Party arising from
        this Agreement or relating in any way to a visit to the Gym shall be submitted to
        binding arbitration according to and administered by the American Arbitration
        Association. The arbitration will be governed by the substantive laws of the State of
        California, not including the California Arbitration Act or the laws of the State of California
        which may apply the laws of another jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted
        in Los Angeles county, California, or elsewhere as the parties may agree. VISITOR ON BEHALF
        OF HIMSELF/HERSELF AND/OR MINOR VISITOR, WAIVES THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL
        AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE
        OR A JURY, ELECTING INSTEAD TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BY BINDING
        ARBITRATION.`,
    
    "t15":
    `i) I understand that if I misrepresent my age or relationship with a minor Visitor or my, or the
        minor’s, mental or physical condition, I, or the minor for whom I purport to sign, will, in the
        event of a loss suffered, be considered a forger and a trespasser, and entitled to no more than
        the rights of a trespasser on the premises of the Gym or other activity site; and I agree to
        release, not to sue, and to protect, hold harmless and indemnify the Released Parties with
        respect to losses suffered by, or caused by, me or the child as provided above.`,
